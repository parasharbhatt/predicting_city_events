Project:

Predicting Safety events in US Cities

## Tasks:
 [A] analyze available events data to identify trends, seasonality impact and consistency of data across different US cities.
 
 [B] build a machine learning model to predict the number of events of a given type for a particular date and location to better plan the allocation of city resources. The use of external datasets is likely necessary to improve model performance.

 [C] make predictions more explainable by using model interpretability tools. You also need to ensure that the model won’t lead to undesired biases or discrimination when it is put into production.

 [D] Evaluate the model performance during city-wide lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, and apply corrections, if necessary.
